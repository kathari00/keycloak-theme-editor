## Presenter tips

- Press `S` to open speaker notes (requires popups to be allowed).
- Use the browser zoom for room/projector sizing (deck is designed for 16:9).
- This deck loads Reveal.js from a CDN. If you need offline presenting, vendor Reveal.js into this folder and update the links in `index.html`.
